    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Not long ago I decided to combine everything I know about SEO with my web development skills into a web application. This is how <a href="http://rubyseotools.com">Ruby SEO Tools</a> was born, a tool that helps marketers analyze how well their blog posts are optimized for SEO.</p>

<p>The first version of Ruby SEO Tools was built in just a handful of days—it could very well be the product of a hackathon. And since many friends of mine want to participate in a hackathon and aren’t sure <em>how</em> to get organized, I decided I’d document my process in hopes that you could get an idea or two.</p>

<p>Keep reading to find out how I built a fully functional web application in under 50 hours.</p>

<h2 id="first-lets-set-a-few-things-straight">First, Lets Set a Few Things Straight…</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Don’t expect to produce an enterprise-level, feature-rich application in just a few hours.</li>
  <li>Brainstorm as many features as you wish. Then select a single feature and implement it.</li>
  <li>You should have a plan of action. If you don’t you’ll run in circles.</li>
  <li>If you have a team, it helps if you all have different skills.</li>
  <li>Try something out of the ordinary and have fun.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we got these things out of the way, here’s how I built the first version of <a href="rubyseotools.com">rubyseotools.com</a></p>

<h2 id="before-starting-to-code">Before Starting to Code</h2>

<h3 id="inspiration-for-the-project">Inspiration for the Project</h3>

<p>Coming up with an idea for your project is obviously the first thing on the list.</p>

<p>I had a few things in mind that I wanted to build but obviously when you are about to invest a good amout of time on something you want to make it count.</p>

<p>It obviously helps if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have experience in the topic</li>
  <li>You know that there is pain involved and that you could aleviate some of that pain</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I finalized the core idea, I started taking notes. I brainstormed, talked with friends and colleagues and put all my ideas (good and bad) in a document. This is not the time to decide whether they are good or bad. My main goal was to collect a good amount of ideas.</p>

<h3 id="the-project-plan">The “Project Plan”</h3>

<p>I created a Google Doc and put in it all the following:</p>

<h4 id="about">About</h4>

<p>Here’s where I listed the name, logo, url and description of the project.</p>

<h4 id="features">Features</h4>

<p>In this section I went wild, literally. I wrote down as many ideas and features as I could.</p>

<p>Quickly I started realizing what my starting point should be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A tool where a marketer can provide the URL of his/her blog post and get a report with SEO recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="user-experience">User Experience</h4>

<p>With the core idea in place, I started creating some basic user stories as well as the user flow from when a visitor arrives to the home page until they are done with the tool.</p>

<h4 id="seo-performance-metrics">SEO Performance Metrics</h4>

<p>By now, the idea has taken some shape and form. At this moment, I had to decide which metrics I should implement in this first version.</p>

<p>I had two main criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How much value is the end-user going to get from the metric</li>
  <li>How easy is it to implement this metric</li>
</ol>

<p>With this in mind I gathered a set of about 15 metrics that I knew I could develop within a few quick hours. This was great starting point that I could then use to build on.</p>

<h4 id="database-architecture">Database Architecture</h4>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary here. With all the information in hand I built my models. It’s always a good idea to start simple and add complexity if necessary.</p>

<h4 id="technologies-i-want-to-use">Technologies I Want to Use</h4>

<p>Pretty obvious but I made a list of all the things I wanted to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rails API for my back-end</li>
  <li>Angular.js for my front-end</li>
  <li>RSpec to test my business logic and models</li>
  <li>Code Climate for code review and test coverage</li>
  <li>Gemnasium to check dependencies</li>
  <li>Codeship for continuous integration</li>
  <li>Heroku to host Rails</li>
  <li>Github to host HTML/CSS/JS</li>
  <li>Nokogiri for HTML parsing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="developing-the-application">Developing the Application</h2>

<h3 id="service-oriented-architecture">Service Oriented Architecture</h3>

<p>Naturally, the first thing once you have everything ready is setting up your environment and initializing your project.</p>

<p>For this project I used the following architecture:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ruby-seo-tools-architecture.svg" alt="Ruby SEO Tools - Architecture" /></p>

<p>I knew I would have my front and back ends separate so two different local repos were in order.</p>

<p>These repos were then linked to their respective Github repos.</p>

<p>Back-end, I linked my GH repository to Gemnasium to make sure my gem dependencies were in good order. I set up Codeship to pull from Github, run the tests and push to Heroku if everything passed. And of course set up New Relic to monitor my Heroku server.</p>

<p>Front-end, I didn’t write tests so I simply tested locally and pushed to a gh-pages branch when everything looked good. I added Google Analytics to keep an eye on traffic and got a custom domain which I routed through Cloudflare DNS. And of course, Angular chats with Rails through a RESTful API using AJAX.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-environments">Setting Up Environments</h3>

<p>You can start seeing how everything is coming along nicely.</p>

<p>Two folders, one for each end. In one, I initialized a Rails API application running Postgres. In the other, I created the boilerplate files and folders, including Angular and Bootstrap through Bower.</p>

<h3 id="defining-end-points-for-my-api">Defining End-Points for my API</h3>

<p>For each report that the end-user would like to generate I wanted to make a single call to the Rails server and get a pass response with the report data or a fail response.</p>

<p>Simple enough, right? That’s my goal, given the limited amount of time.</p>

<h3 id="developing-the-back-end">Developing the Back-end</h3>

<p>Here’s where the real coding begins.</p>

<p>Even though I had limited amount of time in hand I still wanted to do TDD so I decided to test my business logic and selectively test my controller and models.</p>

<p>So, as you can imagine I started writing tests for my SEO analysis and built a module that hosts all the methods that do that.</p>

<p>Once my server was consistently delivering a RESTful endpoint, I pushed it on Github and soon had it live on Heroku via Codeship.</p>

<p>Finally, I set a custom subdomain for my API server, api.rubyseotools.com, and now I was ready to start building my front-end.</p>

<h3 id="workin-on-the-front-end">Workin on the Front-end</h3>

<p>I wanted to try Angular Material but after spending a few hours on it, I realized that it would be more trouble than I thought.</p>

<p>So, I went with a combination of Angular.js and Boostrap which I was familiar with and could start developing immediately.</p>

<p>Nothing too special here, I put together a factory to communicate with my API and then designed a simple front-end UI that displays the information.</p>

<h2 id="getting-past-v001">Getting Past v0.0.1</h2>

<p>With a first functioning version of my application, I started implementing more SEO metrics using the following process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pick the metric</li>
  <li>Write the tests</li>
  <li>Write the code that makes the tests pass</li>
  <li>Expose it to the API</li>
  <li>Pull it and display it on the front end</li>
  <li>Make sure everything looks good and tests pass</li>
  <li>Push to production</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="polishing-and-marketing">Polishing and Marketing</h2>

<p>I consider this step is very important so I gave myself enough time to polish the front-end and make it look great everywhere (yep, I did do some cross-browser and cross-device testing).</p>

<p>I also took some time writing a few nice words and making gifs so that visitors have a delightful experience when they visit for the first time and know what to do when they get there.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As you see, planning is equally as important as developing in my eyes. If you have a roadmap you’ll have a <em>significantly</em> easier time building your project.</p>

<p>Also, many think that TDD takes up a lot of time but I really feel like it’s much faster than manually testing everything all the time when you can simply run the tests.</p>

<p>Finally, hackathons and small projects like this one are lots of fun. So no matter what happens, make sure you enjoy yourself!</p>

<p>I hope this helps and would love to hear what your thoughts are in the commends below.</p>
